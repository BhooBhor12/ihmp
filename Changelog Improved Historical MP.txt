0.9
- Fixed back the reduced General command capacity to assignable General traits that was accidentally removed in 0.8
- Skilled staffer can be gained if you have 18 or more divisions in an army instead of 24.
- Gave submarines 5 times as much hitpoints ( to help them survive vs Naval bombers and make the Battle of the Atlantic more of an attritional fight ).
- Gave DD depth charges ~5 times as much sub_attack and limited them to 1 module per DD to promote refitting / using older DDs for ASW duties ( as historical ), make balancing easier, and to make fleet Destroyers with good ASW feasible.
- Increased DD base sub_attack from 1 to 5 ( for same resons as above ).
- Lowered hit chance of depth charges significantly.

0.8

- Added 1 NFs each for JAP/UK/USA for Emergency Convoy Shipbuilding if their free convoys stockpile drop low which gives 3/6/9 dockyards and 100/200/300 extra convoys.
- Lowered how many % of convoys on a route that submarines will generally spot when attacking to be 1/10:th as many ( should normally be around 15-35% of total still )

- Gave UK resource rights for all fuel in Iran/Iraq.
- Increased air fuel consumption by ~15%
- Increased army/land fuel consumption by 40%
- Tweaked fuel so that it's now very slowly lost in green supply when moving or attacking.
- Increased fuel capacity on units to a max of 9 days of full movement consumption and 6.5 days full offensive combat consumption when completely cut off ( about 30% increase ).
